# `picol501_hs`

```
This was a testbed for learning Haskell.

I was just having fun.  This code dates back to Oct 2011.

--------------------------------------------------------

tcl.hs is a minimalist subset of Tcl, implememted in Haskell.

The inspiration comes from Picol, by Salvatore "antirez" Sanfilippo,
a minimalist subset of Tcl in around 500 lines of ANSI C:

  code: http://antirez.com/picol/picol.c.txt

I'm trying to write a similar subset of Tcl in Haskell.
I'm not trying for an exact duplicate of antirez's Picol,
merely his style, and I think I may extend Picol,
so I'm calling it Picol501.

--------------------------------------------------------

joy.hs is a little subset of Joy, embedded in the above Tcl.
